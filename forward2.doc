         Program documentation for PC on FORWARD.DOC. 

PURPOSE: To run a geodetic forward to obtain geodetic coordinates.
         Latitudes : North/South Hemisphere (+/- 0 to  89 59 59.9999)    
         Longitude : East/West Hemisphere   (+/- 0 to 359 59 59.9999)

DATE:    1985 SEPTEMBER 
         2002 AUGUST 

INPUT: - Ellipsoid options :

         - GRS80 / WGS84
         - Clarke 1866
         - Any other ellipsoid

       - Geodetic coordinates :            First Station (FROM station)
       - Forward Azimuth (from North) to : Second Station (TO station)
       - Distance (in meters) to :         Second Station (TO station)


OUTPUT:
       - Geodetic coordinates :                   Second Station
       - Latitude of Second Station (TO station)
       - Longitude of Second Station (TO station)
       - Back azimuth (from North) to :           First Station


EXECUTING FORWARD:

       Hardware requirements:

      - Can be run from hard disk or floppy disk.
      - The 8087 math co-processor.
      - 120K of main memory
      - A printer with 80 character/line if hard copy is desired.

       You will be supplied with with a floppy disk containing a file:
       FORWARD.EXE.  If you want to run from floppy disk, set the drive
       that contains the floppy to default.  If you have a hard disk
       drive, you may want to load this program onto it so it may 
       permanently reside there.

       To execute:

       Type in - FORWARD

       Respond appropriately to prompts.

       A sample copy of a run is listed below:








Program Forward  -  Version 2.0    

Ellipsoid options :

1. GRS80 / WSG84  (NAD83)
2. Clarke 1866    (NAD27)
3. Any other ellipsoid

Enter choice : 2

  Enter First Station
                             
hDD MM SS.sssss  Latitude :      (h default = N )
 35 00 16.99130

hDDD MM SS.sssss Longitude :     (h default = W )

Second Station :      
---------------- 
  LAT =  35 00 00.00000 North
  LON = 129 00 00.00000 West 

Forward azimuth        FAZ = 120 36 34.3000 From North
Back azimuth           BAZ = 300 36 54.3178 From North
Ellipsoidal distance     S =      1028.2340 m

Do you want to save this output into a file (y/n)?  y

   Enter the output filename :   any_file_name

   Enter the First Station name : FROM

   Enter the Second Station name : TO


1. Another forward, different ellipsoid.
2. Same ellipsoid, two new stations. 
3. Same ellipsoid, same First Station.
4. Let the Second Station be the new First Station.
5. Done

Enter choice : 5


    The forward program is in ANSI standard Fortran 77.  The source code
is on FORWARD.FOR.  This code may be compiled with either the Profort or
RMfort compilers and linked to create the executable FORWARD.EXE.
