# forward
The geodetic program FORWARD is the tool for computing the latitude and longitude of a point, given the latitude and longitude of a starting point and the geodetic azimuth and geodetic distance between the points.

The three-dimensional versions of the geodetic inverse program FORWARD3D includes the ellipsoid height component.  Also included in the 3D program is:

1) Conversions between geodetic positions (latitude, longitude, and ellipsoid height) and rectangular coordinates (X,Y,Z in the
Conventional Terrestrial Reference System).

2) Conversions between the following four observation sets:
   a) DN,DE,DU (differential N, E, U using the FROM station 
       as the origin of the NEU-coordinate system.)
   b) DX,DY,DZ (differential X, Y, Z used to express GPS vectors)
   c) delta height, forward azimuth, ellipsoidal distance
   d) delta height, forward azimuth, mark-to-mark distance
