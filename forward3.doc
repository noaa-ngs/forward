         Program documentation for PC on FORWARD.DOC. 

PURPOSE: To run a geodetic forward to obtain geodetic coordinates.

         Latitudes : North/South Hemisphere (+/- 0 to  89 59 59.9999)  
         Longitude : East/West Hemisphere   (+/- 0 to 179 59 59.9999)

DATE:    1985 SEPTEMBER 
         2002 AUGUST (SID SAFFORD) 
         2004 APRIL  (SID SAFFORD)

INPUT: - Ellipsoid options :

         - GRS80 (NAD83) / WGS84
         - Clarke 1866 (NAD27)
         - Any other ellipsoid

       - Geodetic coordinates :            First Station (FROM station)
       - Forward Azimuth (from North) to : Second Station (TO station)
       - Distance (in meters) to :         Second Station (TO station)


OUTPUT:
       - Geodetic coordinates :                   Second Station
       - Latitude of Second Station (TO station)
       - Longitude of Second Station (TO station)
       - Back azimuth (from North) to :           First Station


EXECUTING FORWARD:

       Hardware requirements:

      - Can be run from hard disk or floppy disk.
      - The 8087 math co-processor.
      - 120K of main memory
      - A printer with 80 character/line if hard copy is desired.

       You will be supplied with with a floppy disk containing a file:
       FORWARD.EXE.  If you want to run from floppy disk, set the drive
       that contains the floppy to default.  If you have a hard disk
       drive, you may want to load this program onto it so it may 
       permanently reside there.

       To execute:

       Type in - FORWARD

       Respond appropriately to prompts.

       A sample copy of a run is listed below:



Program Forward  -  Version 3.0    

Ellipsoid options :

1. GRS80 (NAD83) / WGS84 
2. Clarke 1866 (NAD27)
3. Any other ellipsoid

Enter choice : 2

How would you like to input the data?

1 = By Keyboard
2 = By File
-> 1

Write output to a file (y/n)?
-> y

Output file name?

  Enter FROM STATION NAME (Standpoint) : 
SAMPLE_ONE
                            
  Enter FROM STATION GP (Geodetic Position) : 
hDD MM SS.sssss  Latitude :      (h default = N )
 35 00 16.99130

hDDD MM SS.sssss Longitude :     (h default = W )
 129 00 34.89797


  Enter  TO  STATION NAME (Forepoint) : 
SAMPLE_TWO

DDD MM SS.sss    Forward Azimuth :   (from North) 
120 36 34.30

DDDDDD.dddd      Ellipsoid distance : (in meters) 
1028.234


Second Station : SAMPLE_TWO 
---------------- 
  LAT =  35 00 00.00000 North
  LON = 129 00 00.00000 West 

Forward azimuth        FAZ = 120 36 34.3000 From North
Back azimuth           BAZ = 300 36 54.3178 From North
Ellipsoidal distance     S =      1028.2340 m


Enter your choice ...
 1 = FORWARD  -- Do another Forward
 0 = EXIT     -- End the Program
 -> 0


    The forward program is in ANSI standard Fortran 77.  The source code
is on FORWARD.FOR.  This code may be compiled with either the Profort or
RMfort compilers and linked to create the executable FORWARD.EXE.
